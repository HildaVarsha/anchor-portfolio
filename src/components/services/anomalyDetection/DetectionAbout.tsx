      "We collect data from your IT infrastructure, including internal software systems, connected devices and assets, and third-party services, then send it to the cloud. There, custom-trained machine learning models analyze the data, detect deviations from a defined baseline, and alert you to take action.",

    description:
      "To reduce data latency and cloud infrastructure costs in mission-critical systems like production line monitoring, autonomous vehicles, traffic management, and medical IoT solutions, we configure anomaly detection systems to run directly on the device. Data that doesn't require immediate analysis is securely bulk-uploaded to the cloud for later processing and storage.",
